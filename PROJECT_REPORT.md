- URL and keyword risk analysis
- Web dashboard with filtering, export, and CRUD operations
- Email notifications for phishing alerts
- SQLite database for persistent scan logging

---

## Project Architecture

### System Components

#### 1. **Gmail Watcher (`gmail_watcher.py`)**

**Purpose**: Background service monitoring Gmail inbox for new emails

**Functionality**:
- Authenticates with Gmail API using OAuth 2.0
- Fetches unread emails every 5 minutes
- Extracts email metadata (sender, subject, body)
- Skips system/notification emails (noreply, mailer-daemon, etc.)
- Sends emails to Flask API for analysis
- Receives phishing verdict and confidence scores
- Labels emails in Gmail ("PhishScanAI-Phishing" or "PhishScanAI-Safe")
- Logs results to SQLite database
- Sends alert emails for phishing detections

**Key Libraries**:
- `google-auth-oauthlib`: OAuth authentication
- `googleapiclient`: Gmail API interactions
- `sqlalchemy`: Database ORM
- `requests`: HTTP communication with Flask API

**Database Used**: `./scan_records.db` (main project root)

---

#### 2. **Flask API & Dashboard (`app.py`)**

**Purpose**: REST API for email analysis and web dashboard for history management

**API Endpoints**:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/health` | GET | Health check |
| `/api/analyze` | POST | Analyze email for phishing |
| `/api/test-samples` | GET | Get test phishing/legitimate samples |
| `/scan-history` | GET | View scan history with filters |
| `/delete/<id>` | POST | Soft-delete scan record |
| `/undo-delete/<id>` | POST | Restore deleted record |
| `/export` | GET | Export records as CSV |

**Functionality**:
- Loads fine-tuned BERT model (`ealvaradob/bert-finetuned-phishing`) on startup
- Receives email from watcher, extracts text, subject, sender
- Runs BERT inference to get phishing probability (0-100%)
- Extracts all URLs from email body
- Analyzes each URL for:
  - Invalid URL format
  - IP address usage
  - Suspicious keywords in URL
  - URL shorteners (bit.ly, tinyurl, etc.)
  - @ symbol presence
  - Suspicious TLDs (.tk, .ml, .ga, .cf)
- Extracts and flags suspicious keywords (verify, claim, password, etc.)
- Combines signals into threat score (0-100%)
- Filters threat level (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Generates recommendations
- Stores results in database
- Returns JSON response to watcher

**Dashboard Features**:
- View all scan records in paginated table (10 per page)
- Search by sender or subject
- Filter by phishing/safe/all
- Time range filters (1hr, 24hr, 7 days, all time)
- Soft-delete records with undo action
- Export all records as CSV
- Color-coded threat levels
- Responsive Bootstrap UI

**Key Libraries**:
- `Flask`: Web framework
- `Flask-SQLAlchemy`: Database ORM
- `transformers`: BERT model loading
- `torch`: Deep learning inference
- `validators`: URL validation

**Database Used**: `./scan_records.db` (shared with watcher)

---

#### 3. **Shared Database (SQLite)**

**Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE scan_record (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    sender VARCHAR(255),
    subject VARCHAR(500),
    scanned_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    is_phishing BOOLEAN,
    threat_score FLOAT,
    recommendations TEXT,
    deleted BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0
);
```

**Purpose**: Persistent storage for all email scan results

**Locations**:
- Main: `./scan_records.db` (used by both scripts)
- Optional: `./instance/scan_records.db` (for isolated environments)

**Data Persistence**: All records are soft-deleted (not erased) for audit trail

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Email Analysis Pipeline

```
[Gmail Inbox] 
    ↓ (Watcher fetches unread)
[Gmail Watcher Script]
    ↓ (Extracts sender, subject, body)
[Text Preprocessing]
    ↓ (Sends to Flask API)
[Flask /api/analyze]
    ├─→ [BERT Model] → Phishing Probability
    ├─→ [URL Extraction & Analysis] → Risk Scores
    ├─→ [Keyword Detection] → Flags
    └─→ [Threat Scoring Algorithm] → Final Score (0-100%)
    ↓ (Returns JSON)
[Gmail Watcher]
    ├─→ [Label in Gmail]
    ├─→ [Log to Database]
    └─→ [Send Alert Email] (if phishing)
```

### 2. Threat Scoring Algorithm

**Components**:
- **BERT Model Score**: 0-100% (base phishing probability from AI)
- **Malicious URLs**: +20% per malicious URL (max +60%)
- **Suspicious Keywords**: +10% (if >3 keywords found)

**Formula**:
```
threat_score = min(100, bert_probability + (malicious_urls * 20) + keyword_bonus)
```

**Threat Levels**:
- **CRITICAL** (75-100%): Immediate threat, strong recommendations
- **HIGH** (50-74%): Likely phishing, clear warnings
- **MEDIUM** (25-49%): Suspicious, caution advised
- **LOW** (<25%): Likely legitimate

### 3. URL Risk Analysis

Each URL receives a risk score based on:

| Feature | Risk | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Invalid Format | 30 | Not a valid URL syntax |
| IP Address | 30 | Uses IP instead of domain |
| Suspicious Keywords | 20 | Contains verify, login, password, etc. |
| URL Shortener | 15 | bit.ly, tinyurl, goo.gl, ow.ly |
| @ Symbol | 40 | User@domain format (credential theft) |
| Suspicious TLD | 25 | .tk, .ml, .ga, .cf domains |

**Malicious Threshold**: Risk Score ≥ 50

### 4. Trusted Domain Whitelist

I've pre-configured 80+ trusted domains to reduce false positives:

**Categories**:
- Tech Giants: Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, etc.
- Payment: PayPal, Amazon
- Social: LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit
- Email: Gmail, Outlook, ProtonMail
- Streaming: Netflix, Hulu, Spotify
- Commerce: Flipkart, Swiggy, Zomato
- Dev: GitHub, StackOverflow

**Logic**: If ALL URLs in email are from trusted domains, phishing flag is overridden to safe.

### 5. System Email Notifications

When phishing is detected, an email is sent to `NOTIFY_EMAIL`:

```
Subject: Phishing Alert: Suspicious Email Detected
Body:
Phishing detected!

Subject: [Original Email Subject]
Sender: [Sender Address]
Threat Score: [Score]%
Recommendations:
- ⚠️ DO NOT click any links
- ⚠️ DO NOT provide personal info
- 🗑️ Delete immediately
- 📧 Report as phishing
```

   - For isolated testing
   - Flask can be configured to use this

### Data Integrity

- **Soft Deletes**: Records marked with `deleted=1` but not removed
- **Audit Trail**: All scans logged with timestamp
- **Backup**: Old records can be restored with undo function

### Schema Migrations

If database schema needs updates, run:

```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('scan_records.db')
c = conn.cursor()
# Add new columns or modify schema
c.execute("ALTER TABLE scan_record ADD COLUMN new_field TEXT")
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

## Security Considerations

### Gmail API Security

- **OAuth 2.0**: Secure, credential-based authentication
- **Scopes Limited**: Only read, modify, send (no account deletion)
- **Token Rotation**: Automatic token refresh via `token.pickle`

### Database Security

- **Local Storage**: SQLite on local machine (not cloud-exposed)
- **Soft Deletes**: No permanent data loss risk
- **No Encryption**: Add encryption layer if deployed

### Email Security

- **HTTPS URLs**: Preferred over HTTP (flagged as suspicious)
- **TLS/SSL**: Gmail API uses secure connections
- **No Credential Logging**: Sender/subject logged, not content

---

## Performance Metrics

### Scan Interval

- **Default**: Every 5 minutes
- **Configurable**: Change `time.sleep(300)` in watcher
- **Throughput**: 1-5 emails per scan cycle (depending on inbox activity)

### Model Performance

- **Load Time**: ~1-2 minutes (first run)
- **Inference Time**: ~100-200ms per email
- **Memory Usage**: ~2GB (BERT model + dependencies)
- **Accuracy**: ~90% on phishing detection (based on model training)

### Dashboard Response

- **Page Load**: <1 second (pagination)
- **Search**: <500ms (SQLite query)
- **Export**: <5 seconds (CSV generation)

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

1. **"Unable to Open Database File"**
   - Check `scan_records.db` exists and is readable
   - Verify permissions on file/folder
   - Restart Flask and Watcher

2. **"Gmail Authentication Failed"**
   - Ensure `credentials.json` is in project root
   - Check OAuth scopes are correct
   - Delete `token.pickle` and re-authorize

3. **"Model Takes Too Long"**
   - First run downloads BERT (~500MB)
   - Subsequent runs use cache
   - Ensure stable internet connection

4. **"No New Emails Analyzed"**
   - Manually mark emails as unread in Gmail
   - Verify Flask API is running
   - Check `DETECTOR_API_URL` in watcher

### Debug Mode

- Check console output for errors
- Inspect `scan_records.db` with SQLite Browser
- Review Flask request logs in terminal
- Verify all processes are running

---

## Deployment Considerations

### Production Setup

1. **Use Production WSGI Server**
   ```bash
   pip install gunicorn
   gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
   ```

2. **Store Credentials Securely**
   - Use environment variables
   - Secrets manager (AWS Secrets, Vault)
   - Never commit `credentials.json` to Git

3. **Use Production Database**
   - Consider PostgreSQL or MySQL
   - SQLite suitable for <1M records

4. **Enable Logging**
   - Log to files instead of console
   - Implement log rotation
   - Monitor error rates

5. **Set Up Monitoring**
   - Alert on detection spike
   - Monitor API uptime
   - Track scan success rate
